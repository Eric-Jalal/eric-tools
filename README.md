# Eric tools

You probably had some situations too, when you are doing something that can be wrapped into an smaller automation to make it faster safer and less error prune.
For these situations I most likely use a quicky bash script to do the job. I name them randomly.

Any contribution such as bug fix ask for new tools or criticism are welcome :)


## Replator.sh
Once I change an string which was repeated in multiple files in a directory and it's sub trees. Wrote this shell script to iterate through all the directories and look for the files with the prefix I give and replace the string.
This is basically same find and replace in your own awsome file editor but I wanted a handy CLI for it. Also there is huge room for this to make it bigger and more capable.I'll keep adding features whenever I have needs/time.
